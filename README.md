# GeneticAlgorithm
An implementation of genetic algorithm for an optimization problem.
In the file there are given several products numbered 1..50
Each product is comprised of 10 steps, each required to be perfomed on a certain resource (R) for a certain period of time (T)
Each resource can only work on one thing at a time
The goal is to optimise the total time of producing 50 products, using GA.
